I have implemented frogger game. 

I have included two views in the game - orthogonal and perspective. Switch to perspective by typing c. We can see that the models are 3D in the perspective mode. I have implemented the basic scene, with movement in logs and cars, movement in frog and interaction between frog and scene.

Threejs is quite easy to use and the implementation of the game was much easier because of its simplicity.


Implemented two extra credits
1. Sound - Sound is played for the game, frog jump and when either frog wins the round or loses the round.
2. Score - I also maintain a score for the user which is displayed continuously in the bottom the page. It is also shown once the game ends.
